Project Description

Online Bakery shop that allows users to check for various bakery products available at the
online store and purchase online. The project consists of a list of bakery products displayed in
various categories. The user may browse through these items as per categories. If the user
likes a product he may add it to his shopping cart. Once the user wishes to checkout he must
register on the site first. He can then log in using the same id password next time. Now he
may pay through a credit card or cash on delivery. Once the user makes a successful
transaction he gets a copy of the shopping receipt on his email id. Here we use a user-friendly
interface to make the entire frontend. The middle tier or code-behind model is designed for
fast processing. The online Bakery shopping project brings an entire bakery shop online and
makes it easy for both buyer and seller.
